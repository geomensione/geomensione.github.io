Fix on collision detection (a lot of stupid errors) on ground assets, added enemies (snakes), laser and wall.

Next: collision detection on enemies, kill enemies, health, score, timer, laser temperature, sound, splash screen, credits screen, demo screen, top scores, background(?), timers, bonus, malus...

The todo list is endless!
