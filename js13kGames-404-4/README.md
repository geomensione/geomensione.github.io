Part 4:

swittch challenge, now I try to finish the game for js13Games jam!

Now you can kill the snakes with laser, destroy wall with bomb, you can see score increment on top left of the screen (now it's made with html, but I think to substitute it with a text asset). 
I did a lot of fix on key press events.

Next: collision detection on enemies, add bat, health, timer, laser temperature, sound, splash screen, credits screen, demo screen, top scores, background(?), timers, bonus, malus, map generator.

See you in the next part!
